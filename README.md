# Code repository for *Train on classical, deploy on quantum: scaling generative quantum machine learning to a thousand qubits*

Arxiv paper: [2503.02934](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02934)

The code in this repository can be used to reproduce the results of the paper. 

Scripts to generate or download the datasets can be found in the
paper/datasets folder. Large datasets that take considerable time to download are also avaliable in Pennylane's dataset module (in progress). 

Instructions on how to load and sample from the trained models can be found in paper/README.md

Dependencies:
- IQPopt (https://github.com/XanaduAI/iqpopt)
- qml-benchmarks (https://github.com/XanaduAI/qml-benchmarks)
